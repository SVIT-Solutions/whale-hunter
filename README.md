# Whale Hunter

Whale Hunter is an application designed to analyze and search for wallets in blockchains that have a positive trading history or wallets that purchased tokens before their pump.

At its current stage, the application is under development, and this README provides a brief overview of the project.

## Features

- **Search for wallets that knew about the premature pump of coins**

- **Analysis of possible profits based on wallet history data**

- **Ability to connect your wallet and repeat verified smart wallet transactions for certain coins**

- **Your own workspace with all widgets and information about tracked wallets and tokens**

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: The user interface is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which ensures responsiveness and interactivity.

- **Backend**: Server side logic implemented using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to process data from the blockchain and store user data.

- **Caching and Task Queues**: [Redis](https://redis.io/) is used to cache responses from the coinmarketcap API and block explorer API.
